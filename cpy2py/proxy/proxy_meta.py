    Metaclass for Twin objects

    This meta-class allows using regular class definitions. In the native
    interpreter, the class is accessible directly. In any other, a proxy is
    provided with all class members transformed to appropriate calls to the
    twinterpeter master.

    Using this metaclass allows setting `__twin_id__` in a class definition.
    This specifies which interpeter the class natively resides in. The default
    is always the main interpeter.

    :warning: This metaclass should never be assigned manually. Classes should
              inherit from :py:class:`~.TwinObject`, which sets the metaclass
              automaticaly. You only ever need to set the metaclass if you
              derive a new metaclass from this one.
