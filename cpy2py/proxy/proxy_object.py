Baseclass for objects accessible from twinterpreters

To define which twinterpeter the class is native to, set the class attribute
``__twin_id__``. It must be a :py:class:`str` identifying the native
twinterpeter.

:note: This class mainly serves to set the metaclass :py:class:`~.TwinMeta`.
       It does so in a way compatible with both python 2.X and 3.X. See the
       note on the metaclass for details.
