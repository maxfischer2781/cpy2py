CPy2Py
======

Multi-intepreter execution environment

`cpy2py` allows multiple interpreters to act as one application In parallel
to the main interpreter, other interpreters may be run to execute parts of
the application.

The objects available at the toplevel should be all you ever need:

* :py:class:`~cpy2py.twinterpreter.twin_master.TwinMaster` lets you slave other interpreters to do your bidding.

* :py:class:`~cpy2py.proxy.proxy_object.TwinObject` lets you create objects across interpreters.

* :py:mod:`~cpy2py.twinterpreter.kernel_state` exposes all meta information you need.
