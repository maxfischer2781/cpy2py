Welcome to CPy2Py's documentation!
==================================

To start with :py:mod:`cpy2py`, you should start with the overview pages:

* A quick overview of features is available in the :doc:`README <docs/README>`.
* Key terms are listed in the :doc:`Glossary <docs/definitions>`

Since the API is still being heavily extended, there is not guide or tutorial.
Instead, refer to the examples for various features:

* :doc:`examples/example_function`

The working principles and usage are described in the following topical pages:

* :doc:`docs/objects`
* :doc:`docs/functions`


Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
