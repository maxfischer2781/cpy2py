Welcome to CPy2Py's documentation!
==================================

The purpose of :py:mod:`cpy2py` is to run a single application across multiple Python interpreters.
This allows for portability of old code, as well as compatibility across implementations.

While :py:mod:`cpy2py` strives for usability, it uses some advanced techniques under the hood.
The documentation thus covers several different

* :doc:`docs/tutorial_main`
* :doc:`examples/main`
* :doc:`Readme and Overview <docs/README>`

The working principles and usage are described in the following topical pages:

* :doc:`docs/objects`
* :doc:`docs/functions`
